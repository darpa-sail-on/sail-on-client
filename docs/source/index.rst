Welcome to Sail-On Client's documentation!
==========================================

Release v\ |version| (:ref:`Installation <install>`)

**Sail-On Client** is a library used for supporting evaluation of open world algorithms
in `DARPA SAIL-ON`_. The library is based update work supported by DARPA under
Contract No. HR001120C0055 and is licensed under `APACHE-V2 LICENSE`_.

From the `SAIL-ON Website <https://www.darpa.mil/program/science-of-artificial-intelligence-and-learning-for-open-world-novelty>`_:

    The Science of Artificial Intelligence and Learning for Open-world Novelty (SAIL-ON)
    program intends to research and develop the underlying scientific principles, general
    engineering techniques, and algorithms needed to create AI systems that act appropriately
    and effectively in novel situations that occur in open worlds.

Sail-On Client is being developed as an open source library to support evaluating **vision centric**
open world agents. This involves communicating with evaluation server across a RESTful interface,
providing empirical protocols that are used to systematically evaluate the agents capabilities across
multiple levels of the novelty hierarchy.

Sail-On Client is built upon `tinker-engine`_, an open source library that provides the
abstractions and interface used for running the empirical protocols

Features
--------

The major features provided by Sail-On Client
