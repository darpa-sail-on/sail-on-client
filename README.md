## Running Client and Server with Different Algorithms

Note: If you are using the server setup by PAR, update the `url` to `http://3.32.8.161:5000`
in sail_on_client/protocol/configuration.json and skip step 1 of running the server.

Note: The instructions assume that under given detection, the red-light information is
provided via metadata and under system detection, this information is determined by the algorithm.

## Running algorithms with Local Interface

Self evaluation requires local interface along with ground truth for the tests.
Add `gt_dir` in `sail_on_client/protocol/configuration.json` to the folder containing ground truth for the tests.
Additionally set `gt_config` in `sail_on_client/protocol/configuration.json` to point to domain specific json file.
Refer to `tests/data/OND/activity_recognition/activity_recognition.json` for an example of `gt_config`.

Note: The instructions assume that the configuration required for running the algorithms has been created as shown in the previous section

#### Running Graph Autoencoder with KL divergence Using Pre-Computed Features Without Red Light
1. Go to the sail on client repository
    ```
      cd sail-on-client
    ```
2. Run the client
    ```
      tinker sail_on_client/protocol/ond_protocol.py -i LocalInterface -p config/local_gae_kl_nd_precomputed.json
    ```


## Interpreting Results for Algorithms
The results for the algorithm are stored in in `<results_directory>/<protocol_name>/image_classification`,
where `<results_directory>` is specified by `--results-directory` parameter when the server is executed and `protocol`
name would be either OND or CONDDA.

For OND, every test would have three files. The files follow the following convention `session id.test name.novelty operation.csv`, where
`session_id` is provided by the server, `test name` is specified in the json file and `novelty operation` would have the value detection,
classification and characterization.
